        This project was created by Habil Maseeh to practice building a security monitoring dashboard. The UI is
        intentionally lightweight: hash-based navigation, focused pages for alerts, incidents, and logs, and a clean
        layout for quick scanning. The goal is clarity first, with room to evolve as the feature set grows.
