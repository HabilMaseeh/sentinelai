SentinelAI Project Summary

Industry
- Cybersecurity (Security Operations Center / SOC), specifically SIEM and UEBA monitoring.

Problem Level
- Operational level: day-to-day security monitoring, triage, and incident investigation for SOC analysts and responders.

What This Project Does
- Provides a lightweight SOC dashboard with three core views: Alerts, Incidents, and Logs.
- Shows near-real-time alerts via polling and WebSocket updates.
- Surfaces UEBA incidents with risk scores, timelines, graphs, and contextual details.
- Enables exporting incident reports in TXT/HTML for sharing and documentation.

Why It Needs To Be Built
- Security teams drown in noisy logs and alerts; this UI centralizes the signal.
- Faster triage reduces dwell time and helps prevent minor events from becoming major incidents.
- Clear, structured views help analysts make consistent decisions under time pressure.

How It Helps Industry And People
- SOC analysts get quicker visibility into risk and context.
- Incident responders get a focused workflow for investigation and reporting.
- Managers get clearer operational insight into active threats.
- Organizations reduce response time, improve accountability, and build audit-ready records.

Where to get real logs (no excuses version)

Your own machines
Linux: authentication logs (auth.log or /var/log/secure)
Windows: Security Event Logs
This is the most honest, legal, and relevant source for your system.
A controlled lab
Spin up a VM, enable SSH, and generate real activity (success + failed logins).
This gives you clean, labeled “normal” vs “abnormal” patterns.
Honeypots (real attacker traffic)
Run an SSH honeypot in a sandboxed environment.
You’ll get real attack behavior but do it safely and never on production.
Public cybersecurity datasets
Use them for baseline training or demos, but they rarely match your exact environment.
Treat them as starter fuel, not final truth.
